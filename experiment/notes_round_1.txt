To implement the machine learning model, I'll need the `sensor_data.csv` file. Please add `sensor_data.csv` to the chat so I can analyse its structure and content.

Once I have the data, I will create a new file, `ml_model.py`, to house the solution. This script will:

1.  Load the `sensor_data.csv` dataset.
2.  Automatically determine if the problem is classification or regression based on the target variable's characteristics.
3.  Preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features using scikit-learn pipelines.
4.  Split the data into training and testing sets.
5.  Train an appropriate scikit-learn model (e.g., RandomForest) based on the problem type.
6.  Evaluate the model using relevant metrics and save the predictions and evaluation results to `results.txt`.

I will wait for you to provide `sensor_data.csv`.

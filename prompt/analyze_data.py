**Instructions for Coder LLM: Analyze PECT-NDT Dataset and Save Results**

You are tasked with writing a Python script to analyze a preprocessed Pulsed Eddy Current Testing (PECT) dataset for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) at `{data}`. The dataset is stored in a single `.npz` file and contains the following arrays:

###Information about the dataset:

This dataset consists of thousands of time-series signals collected from a grid scan over a large metal surface (such as a steel plate or pipeline). Each signal represents the electromagnetic response measured at a specific location when a pulsed eddy current is applied. The goal is to detect and characterize subsurface defects (such as corrosion or thinning) without damaging the material.

**How is the data structured?**

- Each signal is a 1D array of 500 time points, representing the voltage response over time at one scan position.
- The scan covers tens of thousands of positions, forming a 2D grid over the inspected surface.
- Signals from defect-free (good) regions and defective (corroded) regions are both included.
- Labels are provided to indicate whether each signal comes from a normal or defective area.

**File contents and shapes:**

- **X_train**: Training signals, shape `(15456, 500, 1)`  
  15,456 signals for model training, each with 500 time points.
- **y_train**: Training labels, shape `(15456,)`  
  0 = good, 1 = defect.
- **X_valid**: Validation signals, shape `(10304, 500, 1)`  
  10,304 signals for model validation.
- **y_valid**: Validation labels, shape `(10304,)`
- **X_scan**: All scan signals, shape `(25761, 500, 1)`  
  The complete set of measured signals from the entire scan area.
- **X_in_corr**: Signals inside corrosion regions, shape `(161, 160, 500)`  
  A 2D spatial grid (161 rows Ã— 160 columns), each cell contains a 500-point signal.
- **Xc**: Corrosion (defect) signals, shape `(711, 500)`  
  All signals identified as coming from defective areas.
- **Xg**: Good (non-defect) signals, shape `(25049, 500)`  
  All signals from normal regions.
- **m**: Mean values for normalization, shape `(1, 500, 1)`  
  Used for standardizing signals.
- **st**: Standard deviation values for normalization, shape `(1, 500, 1)`

**How to use this dataset?**

- Each signal can be visualized as a waveform (voltage vs. time).
- You can analyze the difference in signal shape between good and defective regions.
- The dataset is suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for defect detection, signal classification, or feature extraction.
- The spatial grid (`X_in_corr`) allows for visualization of defect regions as "images" of signal features.

###

All arrays retain their original shapes and are ready for direct use in deep learning frameworks or scientific analysis.
this is the required code you must use when loading the dataset:
 ```python
 import numpy as np

 data = np.load('pect_ndt_full_dataset.npz')
 X_train = data['X_train']
 y_train = data['y_train']
 X_valid = data['X_valid']
 y_valid = data['y_valid']
 X_scan = data['X_scan']
 X_in_corr = data['X_in_corr']
 Xc = data['Xc']
 Xg = data['Xg']
 m = data['m']
 st = data['st']
 ```

## Task

Write a Python script that:

1. **Loads the `.npz` dataset** and prints the shape and type of each array.

2. **Creates a signal comparison visualization**:
   - Select ONE representative sample from good signals (from Xg array)
   - Select ONE representative sample from defect signals (from Xc array)  
   - Plot both signals on the same graph with different colors:
     - Blue line for good signal
     - Red line for defect signal
   - Add clear legend, axis labels (Time Points, Amplitude), and title
   - Save the plot as `signal_comparison.png` in `analysis/figures/`
   - The plot should clearly show the pulse shape differences between good and defective signals

3. **Calculates and saves comprehensive statistics** to `results.json` in `analysis/`:
   - Dataset information: shapes, types, and array descriptions
   - Label distribution for training and validation sets
   - Statistical analysis for each array:
     - Basic statistics (mean, std, min, max, median) for signal arrays
     - Signal characteristics (peak values, signal ranges, etc.)
   - Dataset summary and recommendations for model training
   - Path to the saved comparison plot

---

## Requirements

- **Focus on visual comparison**: The main goal is to create a clear visualization showing the difference between one good signal and one defective signal
- Use only the provided `.npz` file (do not generate random data)
- Use numpy, matplotlib, and json for analysis and visualization
- Ensure the comparison plot is saved as `.png` in `analysis/figures/`
- The `results.json` must contain comprehensive statistics but the visualization should be simple and clear
- Provide clear comments explaining the signal selection and plotting process

---

## Notes

- The primary output should be a clear visual comparison of signal pulses
- Choose representative samples that best show the characteristic differences between good and defective signals
- All detailed statistics and analysis should be saved to JSON for programmatic access
- The plot should be publication-ready with proper formatting and labels

### Requirements
- Do **not** use random data or random seed and synthetic data; only analyze the provided `.npz` file
- Ensure `results.json` is well-structured and comprehensive for PECT-NDT data
- Focus on creating one clear, informative comparison plot rather than multiple complex visualizations

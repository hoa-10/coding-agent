  "Title": "Sensor Anomaly Detection Using Window-Based Classification",
  "Experiment": "Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or LSTM) on time-windowed sensor data to detect anomalies. The dataset is split into overlapping windows to preserve temporal patterns. The goal is to predict whether a window of sensor readings contains an anomaly using classical machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn) or deep learning (e.g., LSTM). Models are evaluated using validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.",
